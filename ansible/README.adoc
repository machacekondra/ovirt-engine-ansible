= oVirt Engine Ansible Modules

== Introduction

This project contains the Ansible modules for oVirt engine.

== Important

Note that most of the code of those modules are automatically generated. If
you just installed the package then you will have everything already,
but if you downloaded the source then you will need to generate it,
follow the instructions in the `README.adoc` file of the parent
directory.

== Installation

This project is currently in developement phase, so for now you can find
rpm builds here in releases section. So download appropriate rpm and run:

 # yum install -y ovirt-engine-ansible4-1.0.0-0.0.a0.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

We install modules into the `/usr/share/ansible` directory. But ansible don't search
for modules by default in this directory. So in order ansible finds your modules you
need to either change `ANSIBLE_LIBRARY` environment variable to point into
`/usr/share/ansible` directory or in `defaults` section in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
file create line:

 # library = /usr/share/ansible

Documentation for modules is located
http://ovirt-ansible-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/list_of_All_modules.html[here]

== Usage

oVirt ansible modules uses oVirt engine API. Every ansible module needs to know connection
details. The recommended way of using API is to use SSO token, so user don't have to login
and logout with every executed task. To create SSO token use `ov4_auth` module:

[source,yaml]
----
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    url: https://ondra.local/ovirt-engine/api
    username: admin@internal
    password: 1234567
    ca_file: ca.pem

  # This task will return ov4_auth fact, used later for authentication
  tasks:
  - name: Obtain SSO token
    ov4_auth:
      url: "{{ url }}"
      username: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
----

The `ca.pem` file is required when connecting to a server protected
with TLS. In an usual oVirt installation it will be in
`/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`. If you don't specify `ca_file`, then
system wide CA certificate store will be used.

One you have created a SSO token, you can later use in all tasks. `ov4_auth`
module will create `ov4_auth` ansible fact.

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Create vm
    ov4_vms:
      auth: "{{ ov4_auth }}"
      method: add
      parameters:
        vm:
          name: test_vm
          template:
            name: Blank
          cluster:
            name: Default
    register: add_vm

  - name: Create disk
    ov4_disks:
      auth: "{{ ov4_auth }}"
      method: add
      parameters:
        disk:
          name: test_vm_disk
          provisioned_size: 1073741824
          format: raw
          interface: virtio
          storage_domains:
            storage_domain:
              - name: om03
    when: add_vm|succeeded and add_vm.error is undefined
    register: add_disk

  - name: List disk
    ov4_disks:
      auth: "{{ ov4_auth }}"
      method: list
      parameters:
        search: "id={{ add_disk.disk.id }}"
    register: list_disk
    delay: 5
    retries: 5
    until: list_disk.disk[0].status == "ok"
    when:  not add_disk|skipped and add_disk.error is undefined
----

In case we want to for example attach disk disk to VM, we need to known vm href.
Every task will return the JSON representation of the API entity.
So in order to attach disk to VM you can reuse the returned JSON as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Attach disk to vm
    ov4_vm_disks:
      auth: "{{ ov4_auth }}"
      service: "{{ add_vm.vm.href }}"
      method: add
      parameters:
        disk:
          id: "{{ add_disk.disk.id }}"
    when:  not add_disk|skipped and add_disk.error is undefined
    register: attach
----

You will find more usage examples in the `examples` directory.

== Development

If you want to setup development environment please follow these steps:

Install ansible:

 # yum install -y ansible

Clone git project:

 # git clone git@github.com:machacekondra/ovirt-engine-ansible.git ~/workspace/ovirt-engine-ansible

Symlink oVirt REST helper module to ansible `module_utils`:

  # ln -s ~/workspace/ovirt-engine-ansible/ansible/lib/ovirt4.py /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/module_utils/

Add generated modules to ansible module path:

  # export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=$ANSIBLE_LIBRARY:~/workspace/ovirt-engine-ansible/ansible

Create a playbook and run it:

 # ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local ~/workspace/ovirt-engine-ansible/ansible/create_vm.yml
