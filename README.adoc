= oVirt Ansible

== Introduction

The oVirt Ansible is a Python package that simplifies automation of oVirt.

IMPORTANT: This document describes how to generate, build and test the
Ansible modules. If you are interested in how to use it read the `README.adoc`
file in the `ansible` directory instead.

== Building

oVirt ansible modules does not depend on any library, so the only package you will
need in order to build ansible modules is python-devel. To install with the `yum`
package manager you will need to do the following:

  # yum -y install python-devel

Most of the source code of the oVirt ansible modules are automatically generated
from the API model.

The code generator is a Java program that resides in the `generator`
directory. This Java program will get the API model and the metamodel
artifacts from the available Maven repositories. To build and run it use
the following commands:

  $ git clone git@github.com:machacekondra/ovirt-engine-ansible.git
  $ mvn package

This will build the code generator, run it to generate the modules for the
version of the API that corresponds to the branch of the oVirt ansible that
you are using.

If you need to generate it for a different version of the API then you
can use the `model.version` property. For example, if you need to
generate the modules for version `4.1.0` of the API you can use this
command:

  $ mvn package -Dmodel.version=4.1.0
